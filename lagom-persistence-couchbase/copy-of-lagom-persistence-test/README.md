copy-of-lagom-persistence-test
==============================

This module contains copy-pasted parts from Lagom project that are not available outside of the project 
because they are not published as part of the result artifacts. 
This module combines the reusable parts, e.g. test suites that are reside in Lagom project in next modules: 

persistence/core
persistence/javadsl
persistence/scaladsl

For simplicity sake here they are combined into one module.
